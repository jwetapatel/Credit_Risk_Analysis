# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used  different methods.

- oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
